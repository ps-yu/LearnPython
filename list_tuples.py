"""
List is a datatype similar to arrays in Java
Can store different dat types
Lists are mutable
Lists allow duplicate objects
"""
# list1 = ["Python", "is", "easy", 1, 2, 3, 4]
# print(list1)
# print(list1[3])
# Mutability in lists
# list1[0] = 24
# print(list1)
# list1[0] = "Python"
# print(list1)
# list1.insert(20, 10)
# print(list1)
# print(len(list1))

"""
Tuples are also built-in data types in python that creates immutable sequence of values
Similar to arrays in Java. The functions operating on the tuples are same as the lists
"""
# tup1 = (1, 2, 3, "tuples")
# print(tup1[1])
"""to create a tuple with one value (,) is required"""
# tup1 = (1)
# print(type(tup1))
# tup2 = (1,)
# print(type(tup2))
# list1 = []
# cue1 = input("Please enter the first name: ")
# cue2 = input("Please enter the second name: ")
# cue3 = input("Please enter the third name: ")
# list1.append(cue1)
# list1.append(cue2)
# list1.append(cue3)
# print(list1)
