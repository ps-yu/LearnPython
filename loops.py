"""While loop in python"""

# Syntax of while loop in python
# x = 0
# while x < 50:
#     print("hello")

# print(x)

# break is a reserved keyword that is used to terminate the loop when certain condition is met
# find the index of number 10 in a tuple
# x = (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 4, 7, 10, 122, 4)
# t = 0
# for y in x:
#     if (y == 10):
#         break
#     t += 1
# print(t)

# Range function in python
