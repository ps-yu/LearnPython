"""
Creating variable in python
Standards for creating python variables-:
Can have upper and lower case letters as well as numbers or (_)
Should not start with a number

"""
Type conversion (Changing the type of variables)
Conversion -: Handles by the python interpreter
Casting -: Manual conversion  
"""
# integer
# a = 2
# float
# b = 4.35
# conversion of int to a float type
# c = a+b
# print(c)

# converting string type into integer using int
# a = int("2")
# b = 2.34
# print(a+b)

"""
Getting the user input from the user in python
the return of a input from the user will always be a string
To get the input as an integer type casting is used
"""
# name = input("Please enter your name")
# print("Welcome ", name)
# number = input("Please enter a number: ")
# print(type(number))
# number = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
# print(type(number))
